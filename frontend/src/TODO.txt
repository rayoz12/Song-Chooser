Fix adding a centre with permissions. What happens is that the centre is added but when the web app redirects to the
edit page the user doesn't have permission to edit that centre so it fails. --FIXED, user is given permission and the token is reissued.

Can't Add user. Problem is that Person_id wasn't set. So Whichever look ups i performed Failed as person_id was null.
--WONTFIX The person field should be treated as mandatory. During the testing phase give directions that users should fill
out all fields on the view.

Convert all manually programmed Bootstrap components to Angular UI components
    - Convert Bootstrap-Dialogs to modals in angular UI
        -- current solution offers more versatility and don't have to edit the HTML of the view.

Staff roster has to be updated to be like the excel roster they use right now.
The screen is split up like so
|         | Monday      | Tuesday     |
|--------:|-------------|-------------|
| Roll    |             |             |
| Staff 1 | 09:30-12:00 | 09:30-12:00 |
| Staff 2 | 13:00-17:00 | 12:00-17:00 |
| Roll 2  |             |             |
This is very complex and will need to investigate.

We also need a more centralised way to manage routes. Currently if you wish to navigate to a route you have to manually
enter it. If we need to change a route's URL for some reason it would break in multiple places. One solution is to create
a service that has an enum of all the routes and a lookup table which corresponds the enum to a route URL.

We also need to fix text so that it is i18n ready, for those chinese customers.

That looks like a promising library.

Saving on edit pages and error handling:
We also need to refactor a lot of the code where the app saves the CRUD. This mainly occurs on Edit page where there are
multiple ID's (due to joins). The app discards the ID when saving meaning that it can't be saved again. Usually this
doesn't pose a problem , however if an error occurs and only a portion of the function is executed, the ID's of the
records are lost leaving the user on the page and unable to save their data. If they try to save it may lead to
corrupted data being saved (undefined behaviour).

Defect List
Known Issues:
When Using Create/Edit Batch if there are more than 2100 parameters (MSSQL hard limit) the SQL will fail.
    - Fix: Split up the data when inserting. Knex Batch Insert is not an option as it breaks in transactions.


Enquiry:
    List:
        Status is displayed as ID rather than actual status.
    There is no support to import a family account from an enquiry. This can be implemented easily though.
    There is no transaction support. Needs to be fixed. --Very Important
    Adding Children on the Edit page. --Fixed
    The page doesn't go back when done.





--Fixed
MAJOR BUG:
    After creating a booking (Booking Day pattern is created). We are no longer able to read Booking Day pattern and any
    reads are hung or timeout.

    How to reproduce:
        - Create a booking with some days activated in the schedule, it doesn't matter if it's placed or not
        - Save the booking
        - Observe the server and web app as it failed to read from Booking Day Pattern, when the app goes to the list
          page.

    Cause/Issue:
        This is because of knex's batch insert which isn't doesn't run correctly within a transaction.
        The booking saves in a transaction and a call is made within that transaction to Knex's batch insert
        which results in it Locking the table and trying to execute. The insert succeeds however it doesn't
        unlock the table afterwards. Resulting in failed reads.
    Fix:
        Removed call to Knex.batchInsert() in favour of a normal insert operations.
